                <h5> Images and geometric data are deleted from our servers immediately after processing. The tool uses
                    standard SSL certificate for security. We do not track your actions, geolocation, or times of usage.

            <div class="question">
                <h3> I am thinking of using this tool for my investigations, or I would like to include this tool as a
                    part
                    of a methodology for a legal court filing or report. What should I know before using it? </h3>
                <h5>
                    You should know that none of the images you upload or rectified are stored after processing.
                    It is important to know that neither pixels' colors are distorted nor new pixel values are
                    introduced; all color data in rectified
                    images preserve their original states, so you can reliably use it as a part of methodology for
                    legal purposes. However, the algorithm tries to preserve the aspect ratio of original images and,
                    therefore, stretches out objects or sometimes blacks out sections for which no pixels
                    exist in the original image. Therefore, you can't rely on estimating sizes of objects through this
                    tool — it is not its original goal.</h5>

            <div class="question">
                <h3> What does it do? </h3>
                <h5> Rectification is a transformation process that projects an original image onto a new plane to form
                    a geometrically perspective-corrected image. It is mostly used in
                    remote sensing / geospatial industries, but becomes very handy for OSINT purposes and evidence
                    analysis.
                </h5>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3> What's the right order of choosing the area of interest? </h3>
                <h5> Ordering of points matters as it would rotate the rectified image accordingly. First, make sure you
                    are choosing in clock-wise / counter-clockwise order.
                    The recommended path is upper left, lower left, lower right, upper right.
